# ChessGame

  • This is a complete Chess game developed using Java Language as backend and its GUI widget toolkit Swing and AWT as frontend.\
  • In this game, As a playes selects a piece to move then all possible moves ofthat piece is shown and also mark the position where opponent’s piece can be killed by selected piece.\
  • I added a functionality to undo the last move.I used Data Structures like Map, Lists, Multidimentional Arrays to control all moves.
